## I followed this tutorial: https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/ that was recommended in the guide.
### There are three essential elements of the app:
#### The screen has a background color
#### There is a large image displayed at the center of the screen
#### There are two buttons in the bottom half of the screen
#### The first button is composed of multiple components (button, circle button, emoji list, emoji picker, emoji sticker, icon button and image viewer). The parent element provides a yellow border and contains an icon and text components inside a row.

- I made some comments inside my code for further explination.
